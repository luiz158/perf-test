== Perfomance Test for JSF standard and PrimeFaces input / select components ==

The goal is to measure the client-side perfomance of JS script block executions for PrimeFaces p:inputText / p:selectOneMenu.
There is no backend logic. For perfomance test, an editable p:dataTable with inputs / selects components within the table cells is used.
The table has 25 rows and 16 columns, that means 25 * 16 = 400 cells. Every cell contains either an input or a select component.

#* An input can be either an JSF standard h:inputText (withput any JS script block) or PrimeFaces' p:inputText (with an JS script block).
#* A select can be either a JSF standard h:selectOneMenu (withput any JS script block) or PrimeFaces' p:selectOneMenu (with an JS script block).

The page load speed is measured with the new [https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html Navigation Timing JavaScript API]
for accurately measuring performance on the web. The API provides a simple way to get accurate and detailed timing statistics natively.
It's available in Internet Explorer 9 and higher, last releases of Google Chrome and Firefox.

The following function is used to measure the time after the current response has been arrived until the window onload event is fired (when everything were loaded and executed). 

<pre>
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(window).load(function () {
        setTimeout(function () {
            window.performance = window.performance ||
                                 window.mozPerformance ||
                                 window.msPerformance ||
                                 window.webkitPerformance || {};
            var timing = performance.timing || {};

            var loadTime = timing.loadEventEnd - timing.responseEnd;
            console.log(loadTime);
            $("#timeOutput").html("Load Time (ms) = " + loadTime);
        }, 0);
    });
</script>
</pre>

=== Compile and Run Project ===

Open your console / terminal window and clone the repository with

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/ova2/perf-test.git
</pre>

The demo web application is prepared to run with Jetty 8 server. To run it with JSF Mojarra implementation, type in the console / terminal window

<pre>
mvn jetty:run
</pre>

To run it with JSF MyFaces implementation, type

<pre>
mvn jetty:run -Pmyfaces
</pre>

This starts Jetty server and the demo app is available under the following URL in a web browser

<pre>
http://localhost:8080/perf-test/
</pre>

Jetty will continue to run until you stop it with a <tt>Ctrl+C</tt> in the console / terminal window where it is running.

Alternative, you can compile the project

<pre>
mvn clean package
</pre>

and deploy the WAR file on every JEE 6 compliant server of your choice.
